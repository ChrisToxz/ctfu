# Clean That F#cking URL
Clean That F#!king URL

## What is this?
A small script that removes all unnecessary url parameters, like Google tracking parameters.
These are mainly used for tracking purposes
Usefull for sharing links to others.

## Why?
Because I heard other people are tired of removing them by themselves.
Want to extend this to something advance which can recognize suspected url parameters instead of hard coded parameters.
